Seriously powerful and data analytics.it taps into big data to find answers and solutions for building better products.
Server less, Just code.it has grown 
from prototype to production to planet-scale, without having to think about, capacity, reliability or performance
It offers many other products such as;
Computing; using the compute engine, App engine, Kubernetes engine from virtual machines with proven price performance to a fully managed app development platform. it also offers
 Storage and Databases ;using Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL,Cloud Bigtable\cite{4} leads to high performance storage for your applications.it enables 
Networking; using tools like Cloud virtual network, cloud CDN, cloud load balancing.
 Big Data; fully managed data warehousing, batch and stream processing, data exploring and reliable messaging using tools like Big query, Cloud dataflow
 Many other products including Data Transfer, API Platform and ecosystems, Internet of things, Cloud AI, ;Management tools, Developer tools, Identity and Security\cite{5}.
